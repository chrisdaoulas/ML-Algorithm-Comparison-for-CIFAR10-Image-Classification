This Jupyter Notebook and accompanying Report is part of my Pattern and Image Recognition Analysis subject for the Advanced Masters in Data Science and Big Data at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. The notebook compares machine learning algorithms on a subset of CIFAR10 dataset focusing on Automobile, Cat, and Dog classes. The project loads and visualizes the data, then evaluates k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN with optimal k=3, accuracy ~76%), Decision Trees (best depth=10, accuracy ~72%), Random Forests (optimal trees=100, depth=10, accuracy ~78%), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP with hidden layers=100, accuracy ~75%), and Support Vector Machines (SVM with polynomial kernel, C=0.1, gamma=2, accuracy ~74%). Parameter tuning via grid search and cross-validation is performed for each model, with classification reports and confusion matrices for insights. The final comparison highlights kNN as the top performer with 76% accuracy, demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and performance analysis for multi-class image classification tasks.
